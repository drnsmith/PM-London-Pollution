# London Air Pollution Prediction
![Pollution](pollution_london.jpg)


This project aims to develop and optimise predictive models for air pollution levels, specifically PM10 concentrations, in London. Our goal is to develop accurate machine learning (ML) models that can forecast these emissions based on various environmental and monitoring data. Various ML techniques are utilised to make accurate predictions, and the models' performances are evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.  This project is based on "London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory 2013" dataset, which is publicly available. Access the following URL:

## Project Tasks
To complete this project, the following tasks were undertaken, we:

 - performed an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and content.

 - preprocessed the data by compiling the dataset with selected features; cleaned the dataset and transformed the target variable (PM10) to make it suitable for modeling.

 - implemented and evaluated several ML algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, XGBoost, and Neural Network Regressor. Each model was trained and tested to predict PM10 levels.

 - assessed the performance of each model using the root mean squared error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. RMSE measures the accuracy of the predictions, with lower values indicating better performance.

 - compared the RMSE values of different models to determine which one provides the most accurate predictions for atmospheric emissions.
